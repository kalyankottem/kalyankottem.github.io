# Project Title: Public Perception of AI

## Abstract

Artificial intelligence is swiftly becoming an integral part of our everyday lives, sparking a diverse range of viewpoints. While some individuals embrace AI with optimism, others express concerns about its implications. Notably, anxieties about job displacement and the potential for AI to lose control prevail. Amidst these apprehensions, a prevailing belief emerges that AI holds the potential for transformative enhancements in domains like healthcare, transportation, and education.

To delve deeper into these intricate perspectives, we harness meticulously curated datasets encapsulating the myriad viewpoints from the public. Through meticulous analysis of this data, we endeavor to discern the intricate fabric of public sentiment towards AI. Our ambition lies in unraveling how AI is perceived, thereby illuminating its far-reaching impacts on our world.
